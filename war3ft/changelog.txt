 - this command is executed on map change: "amx_statscfg off PlayerName" to disable showing team colors during freezetime(finding a mole)
 - icons will no longer load with de_inferno_cz, but they will with other maps
 - added FT_steam, this must be 1 for steam, 0 for 1.5 (you don't have to recompile now)
 - FT_8race is now default
 - skillsinfo for race 9 now works, other race9 code changed up a bit
 - fixed bug where warden would spawn with 50 health if revived (should spawn with 100)

 - fixed an invalid entity error on line 40... THANKS BAILOPAN!!!
 - orc grenades on dod do more damage, and the fuse is shortened to 2.0 seconds

 - FT_claw, FT_bootspeed, FT_bootspeed_dod, FT_health_bonus, FT_frost_speed, FT_mask_of_death, FT_cloak added to war3ft.cfg
